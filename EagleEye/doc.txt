Test Cases that can be automated
1.Number of cta's in the page (by checking cta btn class) and number of clickable cta's
2.Events- landing impressio, install click, install success, search count
3.In FF cws badge and chrome disclaimer should not be present
4.The footer linkouts should have domain name in url
5.Small images in svg format
6.Page title should be the extension name for lander and 'new tab' for new tab page
7.After installation all cta's should be non clickable including cws badge and logo
8.If hover effect is there for all clickable elements (cta + footer links in disclaimer)
9.Please add the tracking class and the corresponding button name in event_action for the logos which are clickable. Any button/image/text which opens CWS window needs to have both the tracker class name and the corresponding button name to be passed in the "data-event_tag" attribute. It has to be done for the following and any future landers that get built: 
10.Console errors in live link
11.If cancel banners show up after cws is closed by clicking on cross button or 'no thanks'
12.Check for both Yes and No criteria of cancel banner- On 'NO', the cws should open again and on 'YES', the opt in overlay should be shown
13.Favicon on window overlay should be that of extension
14.The search box should be on focus on page load of every new tab page

Note:
If the classes are updated, how do we update them in the automated code
